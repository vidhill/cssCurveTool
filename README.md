# cssCurveTool

Little experimental project in early stages, plotting css/Web animation API keyframes on a graph, 
using Snap.svg

Hopeing to visualise easing curves in terms of real values, allow re-timing of keyframes, and preview

Also playing around with ES6, ES6 Modules and Babel, Browserify to package.
